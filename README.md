# Calculator
This project is an interactive calculator with both on-screen buttons and keyboard support. It supports calculations using parentheses, exponentiation, square roots, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. If the input or the output is too long, it will automatically stop input or round the answer, depending on which is being displayed.
